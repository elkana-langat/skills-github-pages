Cloud security has become one of the most important pillars in the tech industry today, and my journey into this space has been both exciting and enlightening.

It all started with foundational certifications. I began by earning **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**, **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)**, and **Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900)**. These gave me a strong understanding of cloud services, architecture, and data management.

My interest in cybersecurity grew stronger as I realized the critical role security plays in cloud environments. This led me to pursue the **SC-900: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals**, which opened my eyes to Microsoft's security solutions like Defender for Cloud, Sentinel, and Entra ID.

Now, I'm actively preparing for the **AZ-500 (Azure Security Engineer)** and **SC-300 (Identity and Access Administrator)** certifications. These two go deeper into implementing real-world security controls, identity management, and threat protection. The learning curve is steep—but incredibly rewarding.

Alongside my studies, I’ve been participating in **CTF challenges**, including one recently hosted at **ALN HOUSE, Westlands**. These events have helped me apply my knowledge in simulated attack-defense environments and improved my practical skills.

This journey has shown me that cloud security is not just about passing exams—it's about continuously learning, adapting, and protecting digital environments in a rapidly evolving world.
